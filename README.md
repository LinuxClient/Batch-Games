This file has 2 batch games in it so far and each game will be updated with new features alot for a while cause i enjoy doing it
The file is completely open source so if you would like to make changes you can just make sure to give me credit for each repost.
The license key/password is the same for each, just go to "license agreement" and it will be there at the top
Please report any bugs you may find and they will be fixed!

ENJOY!!!!!
